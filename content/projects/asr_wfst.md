## Description

Abstract â€” Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are becoming part of daily life. From live captioning to automatic dictation, we have all used ASR in our lives. This report discusses a set of experiments on weighted finite state transducers (WFST) and Viterbi decoder, which are crucial parts of speech recognition systems. We probe WFSTs and Viterbi Decoder in a wide range of experiments and observe their effect on speech recognition by observing the change in accuracy and computational efficiency.
